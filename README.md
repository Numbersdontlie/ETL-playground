# ETL-playground
A notebook that recreates an ETL process is created in this repository 

## What we will do

In this short exercise we will create an initial ETL process to practice and improve skills 

* Read a CSV + Json + XML file 
* Extract data from this file types
* Transform the data extracted into an appropiate format 
* Load (save) the transformed data in a ready-to-load format which colleagues can use to load into an RDBMS
